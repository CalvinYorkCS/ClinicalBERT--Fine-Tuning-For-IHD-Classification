 HISTORY: 58 year old female with metastatic breast cancer.

 INTERPRETATION:  Following the intravenous injection of autologous red blood
 cells labeled with  Tc-[**Age over 90 26**]m, equilibrium images were obtained.

 Gated equilibrium images show normal wall motion.
 Left and right ventricular sizes are normal.
 Left ventricular ejection fraction is 67%. (Normal value >= to 50%).
 Right ventricular ejection fraction is 59%.
 The stroke-volume ratio is 1.3.
 Left ventricular end diastolic volume is approximately 63 cc.
 The blood pressure was 125/80.
 The heart rate was 78.

 When compared to the previous study of [**2181-12-31**], the present study shows no
 significant interval change.

 IMPRESSION: Normal LV systolic function with LV EF of 67%.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
81 year old woman with CAD/AS s/p CABG/AVR. and ct removal
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o ptx
CHEST, AP PORTABLE SINGLE VIEW
INDICATION: Elderly woman with coronary artery disease and
aortic stenosis, status post bypass surgery and aortic valve
replacement. Now chest tube removal, evaluate for pneumothorax.
FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in
sitting semi- upright position is analyzed in direct comparison
with a preceding similar portable chest examination of [**2149-3-18**]. During the interval, the patient has been extubated,
Swan-Ganz catheter and mediastinal and left-sided chest tubes
have been removed. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. In
comparison with the next previous portable chest examination of
[**3-18**], the postoperative mediastinal widening and
perivascular haze in the pulmonary circulation have now
normalized, and the findings are very similar to those noted on
the preoperative examination of [**3-16**]. The latter includes
also mild blunting of the lateral pleural sinuses. Three tiny
ring-shaped metallic structures apparently components of the
aortic valve prosthesis remain in position. As before, rather
extensive mitral ring calcifications are seen. Permanent pacer
in left anterior axillary position with dual electrode system
unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Normalization of postoperative changes, no evidence
of pneumothorax, pulmonary congestion, or significant
infiltrates.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted preoperatively to bridge from Coumadin and be
covered with Heparin. On [**3-18**] she was brought to the operating
room where she had AVR/CABG, please see the OR report for
details. In summary she had AVR(#23 [**Company 1543**]
tissue)CABGx2(LIMA-LAD,SVG-PLV), her bypass time was 85 min with
crossclamp time of 68 min. She tolerated the surgery well and
was transferred to the CT ICU in stable condition.
She did well in the immediate post-op period but did require
Nipride for BP control. On POD1 she started on Bblockers and ACE
and weaned from Nipride. On POD2 her chest tubes and temporary
pacer wirews were removed, her internal pacer was interegated
and she was transferred from the ICU to the step down floor. She
did well over the next several days and on POD6 it was decided
she was stable and ready to be discharged to rehabilitation

.
[**9-21**] Stress: HR 52%
INTERPRETATION: 75 yo man (h/o CAD and ischemic cardiomyopathy
with
LVEF ~10%; BIV/ICD placement [**2101**]) was referred for evaluation
following
an episode of VT. The patient was administered 0.142 mg/kg/min
of
persantine over 4 minutes. No chest, back, neck or arm
discomforts were
reported by the patient during the procedure. The ECG is
uninterpretable
in the presence of ventricular pacing. The rhythm was AV paced
with
frequent isolated multiformed VPDs and rare ventricular
couplets. Rare
isolated APDs were noted. The hemodynamic response to the
persantine
infusion was appropriate. Three min post-MIBI, the patient was
administered 125 mg aminophylline IV.

IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms with an uninterpretable ECG.
Nuclear
report sent separately.


Brief Hospital Course:
.
VT: Thought to be from ischemic cardiomyopathy, ICD
interrogation  showed that he was in VT-->VF-->resulting in 3
shocks with the first two shocks at 35 J being unsuccessful and
the third shock at 35 J successful.  On admission, his
mexiletine was discontinued and he was started on dofetilide 500
[**Hospital1 **].  On [**9-28**], in order to improve his shock vector, he
underwent a subcutaneous shocking coil placement and upgraded to
[**Company 1543**] Concerto. The SCV coil was capped and replaced by the
SQ coil . See separte OP and EP notes for technical details. The
ICD generator was upgraded to a newer model to have the ability
to remoive the ICD can from the shock vector noninvasively if
need be. On [**9-29**], he was noted to have multiple episodes of fast
VT, polymorphic VT, and VF requiring shock (first one
successful).  He was transferred to the CCU at this time (Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2232**]) and his dofetilide was stopped.  Lidocaine drip was
started with improvement in ventricular ectopy.  He was then
restarted on mexilitene 150 TID.  However, on the mexilitene he
was noted to have increasing ventricular ectopy and his dose was
increased to 200 TID.  He was however unable to tolerate this
dose of mexilitene and due to nausea, vomitting, his dose was
decreased once again to 150 TID.  He tolerated this dose, but
did continue to have episodes of VT.  He was advised to refrain
from driving for 6 months.
.
CHF:  He has known cardiomyopathy with EF 10%.  He remained
relatively euvolemic throughout his hospital course.  He was
continued on his home regimen of lasix, digoxin, carvedilol and
lisinopril.
.
Anemia: He was noted to have a Hct drop from 30-->26 on [**10-3**].
He was found to be guaiac negative.  He was however noted to
have a left sided flank hematoma on [**10-3**] which is presumed to be
from heparin during bridge to coumadin.  Heparin was
discontinued at this time and he was continued on coumadin.  His
hematoma remained stable.  His hematoma remained stable to
improved during his hospital course.
.
Atrial fibrillation:  He was started on a bridge with heparin to
coumadin.  However on [**10-3**], due to a new hematoma (see above),
his heparin was discontinued.  His coumadin dose was increased
to 7.5.  His INR was 2 on discharge.
.
Diarrhea:  He was noted to have diarrhea, which was thought to
be a side effect of mexiletine.  His c. diff toxin was negative
x 3.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted after having ventricular tachycardia, which as
an abnormal heart rhythm, and were shocked by your intra-cardiac
defribrillator. You had your ICD revised and tested.  You were
also continued on your antiarrhythmic medication.  As discussed,
you are not to drive for 6 months.  Based on the RMV laws of
Massachusettes, you cannot drive for 6 months time because you
passed out as a result of your abnormal heart rhythm.  After the
6 months, your doctor [**First Name (Titles) 4801**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4656**] you to decide if you can
drive at that point.

Please seek medical attention immediately if you faint, or
develop fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath or any
other concerning symptoms.

You should take all of your medications as directed.  Of note,
your mexiletine dose was increased to 150 three times per day.
In addition, your coumadin dose was increased to 7.5 mg daily.
You should have your INR (coumadin level) checked in [**2-10**] days.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2175-6-29**].


LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate-severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen. RV function depressed.

AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root.

AORTIC VALVE: Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate mitral
annular calcification. Moderate thickening of mitral valve chordae. Mild (1+)
MR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Emergency study performed by the cardiology fellow on call.

Conclusions:
There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with akinesis of the interventricular septum and hypokinesis of the inferior
and inferolateral walls. The anterior wall is not well visualized. Overall EF
is probably less than 30%. Right ventricle is not adequately visualized but
function appears depressed. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate thickening of the
mitral valve chordae. At least mild mitral regurgitation is present. There is
no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2175-6-29**], the visualized
walls appear similarly hypokinetic to akinetic. The anterior wall is not
visualized on the current study. Right ventricular dysfunction is still
present. Mitral regurgitation appears mild (but may be underestimated due to
technically limited study). Recommend full echocardiogram to better assess
regional wall motion abnormalities and severity of valvular disease.

Service:  ACOVE
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 9700**] is a 55-year-old male who
denies any past medical history, who was found down status post
assault and intoxicated in the [**Location (un) 14927**]on the day of
admission.  Patient was transferred via EMS to the [**Hospital3 **]
[**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] Emergency Department. Per records,
patient smelled of ethanol, and was very combative in the
Emergency Department.  The patient had a questionable episode of
hypotension with systolic blood pressure in the 80s, and in
addition was combative on arrival in the Emergency Department.
The patient was then sedated/paralyzed/intubated in the Emergency
Department.

Of note, patient's serum/urine toxicology screen was significant
for an ethanol level of 297.  In addition, in the Emergency
Department, the patient became hypotensive plus questionable
bradycardia in the setting intubation, morphine, versed,
succinylcholine.  The patient was given a fluid challenge,
intravenous atropine with a subsequent return to normal pressure
and normal heart rate.

The patient was then admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for
observation given the patient's intubation and ethanol level.

On the second day of hospital admission, the patient was
extubated without any problems and he was transferred to the
floor.  Trauma series of radiographs was negative as was CT
abdomen/pelvis/head, C spine, CT thorax.

After the patient was extubated on hospital day number two,
he was hemodynamically stable.  He showed no signs and symptoms
of withdrawal, and was transferred to the floor for observation
for ethanol withdrawal, as well as left lower extremity edema
after assault.  When the patient was awake, he was better able to
describe his assault.  Patient states he was in [**Location (un) 5069**],
and ""someone"" assaulted him with a baseball bat to his left lower
extremity.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient denies any past medical
problems.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Smokes one half to one pack of cigarettes
per day.  Drinks ""one half pint"" of Vodka every few days.
Patient specifically denies daily ethanol use.  Denies
cocaine, heroin, or any other intravenous drug use.  Patient
has a girlfriend, lives with his mother, has several
children.  He works at [**Hospital6 256**]
in ""animal research"" laboratory.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  None.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on transfer to the floor:
Temperature 99.7.  Blood pressure 166/80.  Pulse 82.
Respiratory rate 20.  Oxygen saturation 98% on room air.
Physical examination:  In general, this is a middle-aged
African American male, laying in bed, no distress.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Oropharynx pink.  Mucous
membranes slightly dry.  Upper and lower teeth intact.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.  Chest:
Good inspiratory effort, coarse breath sounds bilaterally,
right-sided rhonchi/crackles.  No wheezing.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended, bowel sounds present.  No guarding.
Extremities:  Warm, no obvious fracture, right calf diameter
32 cm, left calf diameter 38 cm, left calf is tense, firm,
but not tender to palpation.  Genitourinary:  Foley is
intact.  Neurological:  Awake, alert, oriented, to person,
place, time and situation.  Cranial nerves are intact.
Extraocular movements are intact.

LABORATORY DATA ON TRANSFER TO THE FLOOR:  White blood cell
count 6.6, hematocrit 37.9, platelet count 257,000.  Sodium
140, potassium 4.3, chloride 108, bicarbonate 27, BUN 8,
creatinine 0.9, glucose 96, calcium 8.1, phosphorus 3.3,
magnesium 1.7.  Ethanol level 59.  CK 3690 (this is increased
from the previous value of 3349).  CK-MB 115, troponin I less
than 0.3.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 55-year-old male status post
intubation/extubation after being found down after ethanol
intoxication and assault on his left lower extremity.  He is
currently doing well, with no signs or symptoms of delirium
tremens on second day of hospital admission.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  Ethanol abuse:  Patient was placed on DT precautions on a
CIWA protocol.  During the [**Hospital 228**] hospital admission, the
patient did not have a temperature greater than 100.  He was not
tachycardic.  Systolic blood pressure was not greater than 160,
and he showed no signs of agitation or confusion, and no
hallucinations.  Patient did not experience any signs or symptoms
of withdrawal during this period.  In addition, the patient
refused counseling for ethanol use/abuse.

2.  Pulmonary:  Patient had coarse rhonchi after extubation,
however, within two days, he had cleared his secretions.  The
patient had an incentive spirometry at bedside for treatment of
his atelectasis.

3.  Nutrition:  The patient tolerated a regular diet well.

4.  Musculoskeletal:  The patient had a left lower extremity
swelling, but was not tender to palpation.  Distal pulses were
palpable.  X-rays of his left tibia/fibula were obtained which
showed well mineralized bones, no bone lesion, no radiopaque
foreign bodies.  There were also no apparent fractures.  Because
of the swelling, left lower extremity noninvasive vascular were
obtained (Doppler), which showed normal color and wave forms.
There was no thrombus seen and there was normal compressibility,
which implied that there was no deep vein thrombosis.  The left
common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were
normal and no intraluminal thrombus was seen.

When patient attempted to ambulate, the patient had severe pain
with ambulation.  An Orthopedic Consult was obtained to evaluate
for compartment syndrome.  Orthopedic Consult: Positive left calf
swelling, but with an intact neurological examination to left
calf/foot, as well as light touch.  His left calf had a negative
[**Last Name (un) 5813**] sign.  Vascular exam revealed palpable dorsalis pedis and
posterior tibial pulses.  X-rays showed no fractures, no
dislocations.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 55-year-old male, status post trauma
to his left calf, but with no signs of compartment syndrome.
Recommendations included decreased weight bearing in his left
lower extremity secondary to pain, and providing the patient
with crutches if necessary for assistance with gait.  Also of
note, the patient's CK continued to rise during patient's
admission, and there was concern over rhabdomyolysis.  The
patient's CKs trended upwards and the patient was aggressively
hydrated.

On hospital day number three, the patient, after aggressive
hydration, the patient's CK began to trend downwards, and on
hospital day number four, the trend continued downwards as well.
The maximum CK during his admission was 3690, on hospital day
three, it had decreased to 2630, and on the day of discharge, had
decreased to 1884.  The patient's renal function remained within
normal limits, and his BUN and creatinine were at 7 and 0.7
respectively on the day before discharge.  The patient was
instructed to drink copious amounts of nonalcoholic fluids after
discharge.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Discharged to home.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  On the day of discharge, patient's CK
continued to decrease.  Patient was ambulating without
assistance, and patient's left lower extremity swelling had
decreased slightly.  Patient was afebrile and his blood pressure
was within normal range, 130/72, and was able to ambulate without
difficulty.  Patient stated that he did not need crutches, and
was walking ""fine.""  Patient denied any pain/tenderness with
ambulation.  Observation of his gait revealed a grossly normal
gait, and patient was able to stand on his left foot without
support, bearing the weight of his full body without any pain.
Since the patient declined crutches, he was given the phone
number to the Orthopedics/[**Hospital 36721**] Clinic to follow-up if
his signs or symptoms worsened or pain occurred.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Rhabdomyolysis, status post trauma to left lower extremity.
2.  Ethanol abuse.
3.  Hypertension ? episodic; may be secondary to pain, status
post trauma.  Should be followed as an outpatient.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Patient was not discharged with any
medications.  Patient was instructed to drink greater than three
liters of water or juice everyday.

DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP:  Discharge follow-up was scheduled with
the [**Hospital6 733**] Clinic, with his new primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  Patient was to follow-up with
his new primary care physician for [**Name Initial (PRE) **] recheck of CK, BUN,
creatinine, as well as evaluation for left lower extremity
swelling, and questionable hypertension.

our vascular surgeon and was recommended to have a cardiac
work-up prior to repair.

An stress echocardiogram at that time was positive where he
was found to have severe left main and two-vessel disease.
He was then referred to [**Hospital6 256**]
for carotid stenting and coronary artery bypass grafting.

He underwent carotid stenting on [**12-22**] by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 487**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D., and was discharged to home following stent

LABORATORY DATA:  None at the time of preadmission testing.

Chest x-ray pending.  Electrocardiogram showed sinus at a
rate of 55, with occasional premature ventricular
contractions, T-wave inversions in lead III and AVF, normal
intervals.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**1-8**] for
coronary artery bypass grafting directly to the Operating
Room.  Please see the operative report for full details.

In summary, the patient had coronary artery bypass grafting
times two with LIMA to the left anterior descending and
saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal.  His bypass time
was 122 min with a cross-clamp time of 100 min.  He tolerated
the operation well and was transferred from the Operating
Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.

At the time of transfer, the patient was in sinus rhythm with
a mean arterial pressure of 80, PA of 25/15.  He had
Neo-Synephrine at 0.5 mcg/kg/min.

He did well in the immediate postoperative period.  His
anesthesia was reversed, and he was successfully extubated.
On postoperative day #1, the patient remained hemodynamically
stable, and he was transferred to ................ for
continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.

His chest tubes remained in place on postoperative day #1, as
he had a significant amount of drainage.  On postoperative
day #2, the patient was noted to have rapid atrial
fibrillation with a ventricular response of 140-160 and a
blood pressure ranging from 90-110, not associated with any
dizziness, shortness of breath, or chest pain.

At that time, the patient was started on Amiodarone, and by
on postoperative day #3, the patient had converted to normal
sinus rhythm.

Over the next several days, the patient had an uneventful
postoperative course.  He did however, have an additional
episode of atrial fibrillation on postoperative day #4, and
at that time, he was started on Heparin infusion, and

Pertinent Results:
Echocardiogram [**2160-7-10**]
Conclusions
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left
atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The
right ventricle displays normal free wall contractility. There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There
are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 0.6cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-21**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The posterior leaflet is calcified and immobilized.
Mild to moderate ([**1-21**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
notified in person of the results in the operating room at the
time of the study.

POST BYPASS The patient is AV paced. There is normal
biventricular systolic function. There is a bioprosthesis in the
aortic position. It appears well seated. The ;leaflets can not
be definitively seen. There is trace valvualr and trace
paravalvular aortic regurgitation seen. At a cardiac output of
4.5 liters/minute, the maximum gradient through the valve was 35
mmHg with a mean of 17 mmHg at an effective area of 1.4 cm2. The
mitral regurgitation is improved and is now mild. The tricuspid
regurgitation is also improved, now mild. The thoracic aorta is
intact after decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2160-7-10**] where
the patient underwent Aortic valve replacement ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 17167**] [**Male First Name (un) 923**])
and coronary artery bypass graft (SVG-distal RCA).   Overall the
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.  She extubated POD1. The patient was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable, weaned from
inotropic and vasopressor support.  The patient was transferred
to the telemetry floor for further recovery. Chest tubes and
pacing wires were discontinued without complication.

Respiratory: Aggressive pulmonary toilet, nebs and ambulation
her oxygenation improved. Inhalers were continued.

Cardiac: hemodynamically stable in sinus rhythm.  SBP 130-140's
low-dose Lisinopril was started.  Statin restarted.

GI: history of constipation. Her previous laxatives were
resumed.

Renal; gently diuresed toward her preop weight- contiues to
require diuresis.  Baseline CRE 1.7-2.0.  Electrolytes were
repleted as needed.

Endocrine: Insulin sliding scale to maintain BS < 150.
Colchicine was restarted for her history of gout.

Skin: She was followed by the wound care service for a
longstanding stage 4 pressure ulcer following pilonidal cyst
measuring 2 x1 cm with minimal depth. Some undermining. Peri
wound tissue is macerated with copious serous drainage.  They
recommended pressure ulcer guidelines and dressing changes.

Neuro: Antidepressant was restarted.  Valium held secondary to
lethargy. once mental status returned to baseline her Oxycodone
for standing back pain was resumed and toelrated well.  Nicotine
patch applied.

Disposition: She was followed by physical therapy.  She was
returned to [**Hospital 392**] Rehabilitation & Nursing Center [**Telephone/Fax (1) 92342**]
on POD# 5.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 33-year-old
female, with type 2 diabetes mellitus, poorly controlled
diabetes, who was admitted to the Fenard Intensive Care Unit
on [**2202-3-31**] with diabetic ketoacidosis.  The patient
had been vomiting for several days with chronic diarrhea, and
on admission had an initial blood pressure of 70/palp, and in
the Emergency Department was found to have a blood glucose
level of 1,400, an anion gap of 55, and a serum bicarbonate
of 6.  She received 7 liters of normal saline, potassium
repletion, 55 units of insulin, and then was put on insulin
GTT in the ED.  The patient had coffee ground emesis, melena
on admission.  Coffee ground emesis was cleared after a 350
cc NG lavage.  Her course was also notable for T wave
inversions in the inferolateral leads, and a troponin of 2.5.
The patient also grew out Clostridium perfringens,
lactobacillus and coag-negative staph aureus from her initial
blood cultures.  She also was found to have acute on chronic
prerenal failure.  The patient was initially given 1 gm of
vancomycin for her bacteremia before speciation in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**],
and was later started on clindamycin.  Her lytes were
repleted and free water was repleted for her hypernatremia on
admission in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], and she was then called out to the
floor.  Upon call-out, the patient was complaining of tender
left upper chest pain at her central line site, but no
fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 33-year-old female with type 1
diabetes mellitus admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis, upper
GI bleed with coffee ground emesis, increased troponin to
2.5, Clostridium perfringens bacteremia.  The patient was
initially admitted to the Fenard ICU for care of her severe
diabetic ketoacidosis, and when this was under control she
was transferred to the floor for further care and
dispositioning.

1) DIABETES TYPE 1:  DKA was treated in the Intensive Care
Unit and resolved at time of call-out to the floor.  However,
the patient's blood sugars were labile from a low of 38 to a
high of 480 while on the floor.  Her Lantus dose had been
decreased from her outpatient dose of 32 to her inpatient
current dose of 20 q hs because of repeatedly low blood
sugars in the morning, as low as 38.  The patient's blood
sugar was controlled with Lantus 20 q hs and qid sliding
scale.  The patient will be discharged on this dose of Lantus
20 q hs with qid Humalog sliding scale, and she was given
this sliding scale on a paper copy.  She will follow-up with
the [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes Center, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3273**], in two days after
discharge for further diabetic care, as she has not been
followed by an endocrinologist in the past according to her.
Because of her frequent admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis,
it was stressed that it was very important that the patient
make this appointment at the [**Last Name (un) **].

2) BACTEREMIA:  The patient grew out Clostridium perfringens,
lactobacillus and coag-negative staph from her initial blood
cultures.  An ID consult was obtained.  They had thought that
the lactobacillus and coag-negative staph were likely
contaminants in the setting of a femoral line being placed in
the Emergency Room and on an emergent basis.  The Clostridium
perfringens, because of its potential virulence, was treated
with clindamycin.  The patient remained afebrile for the
remainder of the hospitalization and will be discharged on a
total 10-day course of clindamycin.  A CT of the abdomen was
performed to further evaluate for possible sources of the
Clostridium perfringens and this was negative for any source
for Clostridium.

3) UPPER GI BLEED:  The patient had coffee ground emesis on
admission in the setting of refractory vomiting from her
diabetic ketoacidosis.  The patient does have a history of
[**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tears, and it was likely that this coffee
ground emesis was secondary to [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tears versus
stress gastritis or stress ulcer.  A GI consult was obtained
that recommended an endoscopy prior to discharge.  The
patient, however, refused endoscopy this admission and was
told risks of not having the endoscopy including rebleeding.
She was initially given 2 units of packed red blood on
admission for a hematocrit drop to 24 with appropriate
increase.  She was continued on [**Hospital1 **] Protonix for her upper GI
bleed.  She will likely need an endoscopy as an outpatient.

4) INCREASED PANCREATIC ENZYMES:  The patient did have
increased lipase and amylase to the 300s on admission.  This
was not thought to be an acute pancreatitis; the patient did
not have any abdominal pain.  Rather, it was thought to be
secondary to the acute stress, dehydration, electrolytes
disturbances of DKA.  These were trending down at the time of
discharge.

5) CARDIAC - CAD:  The patient did have inferolateral T wave
inversions on admission with a troponin up to 2.5.  A
cardiology consult was obtained.  They believed that these
EKG changes and troponin leak were not acute coronary
syndrome, nor signs of an MI, but rather changes in the
setting of the severe electrolyte disturbances and
hypovolemia associated with her diabetic ketoacidosis.  Given
her risk factors of hypertension and diabetes, we ordered a
stress test for the patient.  The patient, however, refused
stress test at this time.  She was explained the risks,
including heart attack, of not having the stress test, and
knowing her CAD status, and the patient was aware.  She will
be continued on her Lopressor 12.5 [**Hospital1 **].  The patient has an
aspirin allergy and was not continued or started on aspirin.

PUMP:  The patient had no signs of CHF on admission and no
wall motion abnormalities on her echocardiogram with an EF
greater than 75% on initial echo.  She had no arrhythmias
during this hospitalization.

6) BLOOD PRESSURE:  The patient's blood pressure was volatile
during this hospitalization in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], but was down to 80
initially with her outpatient Lopressor dose.  The Lopressor
was decreased to 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], and the patient's blood pressure
remained 100-130 systolic.

7) PHARYNGITIS:  The patient did initially complain of throat
pain on admission and did have two white erythematous plaques
bilaterally on her posterior pharynx that were symmetric.  A
culture of these was obtained and was negative for group A
strep.  It was positive for yeast, and she was started on
nystatin swish and swallow qid for question of thrush.  Her
sore throat was relieved.

8) DIARRHEA:  The patient has chronic diarrhea that she says
she has had since the early [**2188**].  She takes Imodium at home
for this.  Her Imodium was held initially because she was on
clindamycin, and there was a low suspicion for Clostridium
difficile.  The patient had negative Clostridium difficile in
her stool x 2, and was restarted on her outpatient Imodium to
control her diarrhea.

9) FOOT ULCER:  These were chronic, likely erythema
gangrenosum.  She had also been followed by podiatry for
these and will follow-up with her podiatrist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
next week.

10) HEME:  The patient has a multifactorial anemia.  She has
blood loss anemia status post her GI bleed and anemia of
chronic disease secondary to her chronic renal insufficiency
and diabetes.  Her initial iron studies were repeated after
her acute illness showed an iron of 40, TIBC 239, ferritin
148, transferrin 184, all consistent with anemia of chronic
disease.  The patient did receive 2 units of blood
transfusion initially.  Her hematocrit remained stable in
27-26 range status post these blood transfusions.

11) FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  In the setting of
her severe vomiting on admission and diabetic ketoacidosis,
the patient was severely dehydrated on admission with large
electrolyte losses of hyponatremia, hypophosphatemia,
hypocalcemia, and was hypernatremic from her free water
deficit.  All of these were corrected in the ICU.  She was
started on a diabetic diet, and her electrolytes remained
stable for the remainder of the hospitalization.

DISPOSITION AND FOLLOW-UP:  1) The patient will start seeing
an endocrinologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3273**], at the [**Last Name (un) **], in two days
after discharge, [**2202-4-8**] @ 3:30 pm.  2) She will follow-up
with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who will be her new primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **]

Service:  NME


CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Right middle cerebral artery infarction,
status post intravenous tissue Plasminogen Activator
administration.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73 year old right-
handed man with a history of hypertension and paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation who reports that he was lifting a heavy 2
by 10 at around 3:50 PM when he felt faint and his friends
called Emergency Medical Services.  He said he was told that
he had a stroke.  The available chart indicates that he was
found slumped over in the bathroom.  Emergency Medical
Services noted that he had slurred speech and a left
hemiparesis.  When he arrived at the [**Hospital6 33**], he
was examined by Neurology where he had an NIH stroke scale of
14 with a partial left hemianopsia, flaccid left arm but 5-
out of 5 strength of the left leg along with left neglect.
He was given intravenous tissue Plasminogen Activator started
at 6:15 PM and transferred to [**Hospital6 2018**] for further management.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  On review of systems the patient did not
have any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, headaches, visual
changes, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations,
abdominal pain, gastrointestinal or genitourinary complaints.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

Hypertension.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Beta blocker.
2. Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Glucosamine.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is married and has three grown children.
He is a former engineer.  He quit smoking in [**2117**] but before
that smoked one pack per day for 25 years.  He quit drinking
many years ago.  He denies any drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  There is no evidence of hypertension,
diabetes or stroke in the family.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission he is afebrile with
blood pressure 193/90, heart rate in the 70s, generally and
in no acute distress.  Neck is supple with no carotid bruits.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular irregular
rhythm.  No murmurs are heard.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.  There is no
cyanosis, clubbing or edema of the lower extremities.

On neurologic examination he is drowsy but arousable and able
to do months of the year backwards.  His language and
comprehension is intact as well as naming and repetition.  He
has a left neglect and does not identify his own left hand or
arm.  On cranial nerve examination visual fields show a left
hemianopsia.  Funduscopic examination was normal.  Pupils
react normally to light.  Extraocular eye movements are full
but with a right gaze preference.  His facial movement shows
a left facial weakness.  Palatal elevation is symmetric.
Tongue protrudes midline.  On sensory examination, he had
decrease to light touch in the left face.  On motor
examination he has normal bulk.  His tone is slightly increased
on the left.  His power is full on the right.  Though his left
side is difficult to assess given the neglect, he does provide
some resistance on the left triceps, however, his left
deltoid, wrist extensor and finger extensors showed no
strength.  With the left leg, he is able to lift it and bend
it against moderate resistance.  On reflex he is diminished
on the left side.  Plantar reflexes are upgoing on the left
and downgoing on the right.  On sensory examination he has
absent touch, pinprick, temperature on the left side.  He
neglects the left side.  He does not recognize his own left
hand.  Coordination examination, he has intact finger-to-nose
test on the right.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data upon admission revealed
white count 3.76, hematocrit 37, platelets 180, INR 1.1, PTT
27, sodium 145, potassium 4.5, chloride 109, bicarbonate 25,
BUN 24, creatinine 1.1, ALT 36, AST 44.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Neurology - Right basal ganglia/ interna
capsule cerebrovascular infarction with right frontal temporal
bleed, status post tissue Plasminogen Activator administration.
The patient was admitted initially to the Intensive Care Unit for
blood pressure monitoring.  His blood pressure was kept
between 140 and 160.  He had a transthoracic echocardiogram
which did not show any evidence of patent foramen ovale, low
ejection fraction or clot.  A transesophageal
echocardiography was not pursued given that he would have to
be anticoagulated in the future anyway given the stroke and
history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  He was ruled out for
myocardial infarction and telemetry showed that he did indeed
go in and out of atrial fibrillation.  A carotid ultrasound
was obtained showing a less than 40 percent stenosis
bilaterally.  He had a hemoglobin A1c  which was normal at
5.8 and lipid panel which was normal showing cholesterol 180,
triglycerides 53, HDL 73, and LDL of 96.  He was empirically
started on a small dose of a statin for stroke prevention.
Later on in the hospital course he did received low dose
Lopressor for rate control for his atrial fibrillation.  It
is recommended that the patient be started on baby aspirin on
[**5-8**] and a repeat head computerized tomography scan be done
several days later.  If there is no progression of the
hemorrhage on the head computerized tomography scan, then he
can be started on Coumadin in three weeks, from the time of
discharge from this hospitalization.  Of note, he had two
serial no[**Serial Number 55670**].8 by 2.9 cm.

Infectious disease - Leukocytosis, the patient did have
increased white count to 14.2.  He had chest x-ray which
showed no evidence of pneumonia.  He had a urinalysis and
urine cultures pending upon admission.  Blood cultures were
obtained but nothing was grown to date.  He remained afebrile
throughout the hospital course.

Fall - The patient did fall one day prior to discharge and a
repeat head computerized tomography scan was obtained showing
no evidence of fracture or increased bleed.  He was then put
on safety precaution with a posey restraint.

Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient was unable
to swallow very well, so a video swallow study was obtained.
It was recommended he stay on a pureed nectar-thickened diet
with crushed pills and ability to only drink from a cup until
he improved neurologically.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Right caudate internal capsule
cerebrovascular infarction.

Right frontotemporal hemorrhage, status post tissue
Plasminogen Activator administration.

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

Leukocytosis.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Aspirin 81 mg to be started on [**2154-5-8**] and then to be
   replaced by Coumadin at the end of [**Month (only) **] if head
   computerized tomography scan is unchanged.


CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehabilitation.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient is to follow up with his primary care
doctor one week after discharge from the hospital.

The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] on [**2154-5-23**] in his [**Hospital 4038**] Clinic.

toxicity

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Liver biopsy [**2146-9-6**]

Paracentesis [**2146-9-7**]

History of Present Illness:
HPI - This is a 69 y/o male with a PMH significant for CAD,
COPD, PAF, DM who presented to his PCP in [**Name9 (PRE) 205**] with symptoms of
decreased appetite, fatigue, and increased abdominal girth over
the last six months. There, he was found to have increased
ascites, worsening liver function, and increased LE edema. He
was sent to [**Location (un) **] for further evaluation.
On initial admission to [**Location (un) **], had elevated LFTs with Alk P in
500's, and AST/ALT in 200-300's range. Amiodarone was d/c'd at
that point, and Medrol 8 mg [**Hospital1 **] was started. GI followed pt
while in-house and CT of abd done showed hyperdense liver that
was c/w possible amiodarone toxicity. MRI was c/w ascites and
gallstone w/o bile duct dilitation. He had an extensive workup
for elevated LFTs, and workup for autoimminue causes, viral
causes, and hemachromatosis were all negative. During his
admission, the LFTs began to trend down to 140-150 range, 200
range for alk phos. Pt was d/c'd to rehab on high-dose steroids.

However, he represented to [**Location (un) **] with abd fullness and SOB [**2-23**]
ascites and anasarca. LFTs during the second admission were
unchanged with alk phos in the 400 range, with acute renal
function worsening (Cr 2.4 -> 3.3). This second admission was
also significant for an increase in WBC from 20 to 38, pt
remaining afebrile.
Upon review of incomplete old records that were obtained, it
appears that the patient was started on Amiodarone 200mg [**Hospital1 **] in
[**12-24**] following a valve replacement surgery c/b atrial
fibrillation. He remained on this dose of amiodarone until it
was d/c'd at [**Location (un) **].

ROS - positive for abdominal fullness, decreased appetite,
recent diarrhea, and fatigue

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 69 y/o man with PMH significant for CAD, DM, COPD, a
fib, who was on chronic amiodarone since [**12-24**] for rhythm
control of a fib, who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH after an
extensive workup for liver disease of unknown origin. Workup
there was notable for hyperdense liver, ascites; and negative
for any autoimmune, viral/infectious, hemachromatosis causes. Pt
also here with ARF on CRI.

1. Liver failure/renal failure - Most likely multifactorial,
also likely that it was [**2-23**] amiodarone toxicity, based on his
prior workup. Workup at OSH for autoimmune and infectious causes
for liver failure were all negative. His hepatitis serologies
were also negative during this hospital stay. Therapeutic tap on
[**2146-8-24**] negative for SBP at the OSH with normal cytology. His
paracentesis at this hospital was also negative for SBP. He
underwent a transjugular liver biopsy which showed significant
amiodarone toxicity with severe fibrosis and incomplete nodule
formation. His venous pressure measurements revealed a Hepatic
venous pressure gradient of 28mmHg consistent with portal
hypertension. It is unclear as to whether the liver biopsy
findings were entirely related to amiodarone toxicity or whether
the amiodarone toxicty was superimposed on a background of
cirrhosis. Risk factors for cirrhosis include diabetes and NASH.
He was initially continued on the high-dose steroids that he was
transferred here with, but was started to be weaned off as they
had no clear benefit. A RUQ u/s with Dopplers showed no liver
masses, + ascites, findings c/w cirrhosis and portal
hypertension, hepatofugal flow in splenic and portal veins, nl
flow in hepatic veins. Given worsening creatinine, he was
started on octreotide/midodrine for suspected hepatorenal
syndrome, along with albumin. In addition, he developed an
Enterococcal UTI for which he was begun on ampicillin [**9-6**]. An
NG tube was placed for tube feeds as the patient had poor po
intake secondary to decreased appetite. Given his liver failure
and probable hepato-renal syndrome, he was evaluated for
potential liver transplant by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**]. Based on the patient's
cardiac risk factors/cardiac history and his poor functional
status, it was decided that the patient would not be a good
liver transplant candidate.
On [**2146-9-9**] he became hypotensive and was transferred to the MICU
for further management. Following transfer to the MICU, the
patient received 2u PRBC, 2u FFP, and Vit K with stabilization
of his blood pressure. His renal function/coagulopathy continued
to worsen, attributed to hepato-renal syndrome. Following a
family meeting on [**9-10**], the decision was made not to pursue
dialysis, as the patient is not a liver transplant candidate.
Per this family meeting, other medical treatment (octreotide,
midodrine, antibiotics, albumin) was decided to be continued,
although the patient was made DNR/DNI from a full code on
admission.
His blood pressures stabilized while in MICU and he was
transferred back to the floor as CMO per patient's and family's
wishes. He eventually expired on [**2146-9-13**].

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 69f with metastatic renal cell ca, cva, and a recent
admission for GIB who presents with one week of fatigue and
pallor and was found to anemic at 26.6 (last hct from discharge
[**1-16**] was 30). She was recently admitted for [**Date range (1) 9892**] when her
pcp found her to have a hct of 24. She had a negative ng lavage,
guaiac negative, egd negative, colonoscopy negative, capsule
endoscopy negative; her fe studies showed a ferritin > [**2115**], and
the thought was that this was related to anemia of chronic
disease. She felt better after her admission, with a ""rosy""
complexion; however, over the next few days she became
increasingly pale and fatigued. On the day of presentation, she
was confused, going into the wrong room at home, unable to
distinguish between dreams/reality; in the ed, she was a&o and
said she didn't feel confused, just that her thinking was
""slow."" She denies recent f/c, ha, focal weakness,
lightheadeness, loc, vis changes, chest pain, sob, cough, abd
pain, n/v/d/c, back pain, dysuria/hematuria.
In the ED, she got 2units prbc and was seen by neurology.

CXR ([**2-1**]): CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.

The upper chest and thoracic inlet is excluded from the film.
Allowing for this, the ET tube is no longer visualized. There
are patchy interstitial and alveolar opacities centered about
both pulmonary hila. No upper zone redistribution or effusion is
identified. The opacities most likely represent resolving
changes due to pulmonary edema and are slightly decreased
compared with [**2121-1-31**]. Multiple clips noted in the abdomen.
Density over left upper quadrant is consistent with
calcification within the splenic artery.

IMPRESSION: Apparent removal of ET tube. Slight interval
improvement in perihilar infiltrates thought to represent
resolving pulmonary edema. Clinical correlation requested.

MRI Head ([**1-24**]): TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted
brain imaging. Diffusion-weighted images were obtained.

FINDINGS: Again seen are areas of T2 hyperintensity in the right
posterior parietal and both occipital lobes. Decreased signal
centrally in the occipital lobe foci are consistent with
necrosis. Increased T1 signal in the rims of these areas is
consistent with laminar necrosis. Associated susceptibility
within these foci are consistent with prior hemorrhage.
Diffusion sequences demonstrate thin rims of increased signal
which may be related to susceptibility or T2 shine-through. No
other diffusion abnormalities are identified to suggest acute
ischemia. T2 hyperintensity in the periventricular cerebral
white matter is consistent with chronic microvascular ischemia.
There is no hydrocephalus, mass effect, or shift of normally
midline structures. Surrounding osseous and soft tissue
structures are unremarkable.

TECHNIQUE: 3-D time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar
reconstructions.

FINDINGS: The major tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] are
patent without evidence of significant stenosis or aneurysmal
dilatation. Within the limits of this exam, no sign of an
arteriovenous malformation is apparent.

IMPRESSION:
1. Overall stable MRI appearance of the brain with
redemonstration of posterior parietal and occipital lobe
infarcts.
2. Normal circle of [**Location (un) 431**] MRA.

EEG ([**1-24**]): FINDINGS:
ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout this recording, the background rhythm

remained in the 5 to 6 Hz frequency range. They did not reach
normal
levels.
ABNORMALITY #2: Superimposed bursts of mixed frequency
generalized delta
and theta slowing were observed periodically. No sharp features
were
associated with this slowing.
BACKGROUND: As described above.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Produced no activation of the
record.
SLEEP: The patient remained drowsy throughout the entire
recording with
no stage II sleep observed.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with average
rate of
72 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of
diffuse
background slowing throughout the recording. In addition,
overlying
bursts of generalized mixed frequency delta and theta slowing
were seen.
No epileptiform features were observed with this slowing. No
electrographic seizures were recorded. This EEG is most
consistent with
encephalopathy. Common causes of encephalopathy include
medications and
metabolic disturbances.



Brief Hospital Course:
FATIGUE/CONFUSION/WEAKNESS: Neurology was consulted in the ED
for evaluation. Among the findings was an MRI that showed no
focal findings, and an EEG that showed a toxic-metabolic
picture. She had a history of [**Doctor Last Name 4116**] syndrome ([**3-13**] bilateral
occipital/parietal CVA felt to be likely in the setting of
vertebro-basilar insufficiency), with an element of [**Doctor First Name 9893**]
syndrome (anosgnosia of visual deficit) elicited by the
neurologist, but otherwise had no new focal findings, and the
encephalopathy was attributed to toxic/metabolic etiology,
likely in the setting of hypercalcemia. She was also treated for
a UTI with Levofloxacin for 7 days.  She was also found to be
hyponatremic on admission; all of these factors, along with her
malnutrition in the setting of malignancy, likely contributed to
her presentation.  She was given IVFs aggressively, with
resolution of the hypercalcemia and hyponatremia. She was also
given pamidronate and calcitonin, and lasix for treatment of the
hypercalcemia. PTH was normal, and the hypercalcemia was
attributed to the patient's malignancy.  The calcium normalized
with the above treatment.  The patient's mental status improved,
although she had a persistent poor PO intake. She passed a
speech and swallow study, but was noted to have had a poor
appetite.  After intubation and ICU stay, her mental status
remained stable and she had a persistently poor appetite.  She
was started on Megace, and prior to admission noted an
improvement in her appetite.

RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: On [**1-30**], the patient was noted to have
coughed a bit after eating, cleared the food, but then developed
acute respiratory distress that required intubation and transfer
to the ICU.  The CXR showed findings c/w pulmonary edema, and
the patient was felt by the ICU team to have developed flash
pulmonary edema.  Her last Echo [**10-14**], showed a normal EF with
some focal wall motion abnormalities.  EKG and cardiac enzymes
were normal.  She was treated with lasix, as well as empirically
for aspiration PNA with levofloxacin and flagyl.  She improved
over the next 3 days, and was extubated without event.  Given
her wall motion abnormalities, diastolic failure in the setting
of ischemia was a distinct possibility, and the depending on the
prognosis of the renal cell cancer, may warrant a stress test as
an outpatient.  Her breathing remained stable on room air, and
she was discharged on metoprolol and levo/flagyl with plan of a
10 day course.

DEPRESSION: The patient was noted to have flattened affect, was
seen by the social worker, and started on prozac for depression.


ANEMIA: The patient was noted on prior hospitalization to have
had a negative workup for anemia including EGD/colonoscopy.  The
anemia was attributed to chronic disease.  She required a few
transfusions, and on d/c her Hct was stable.

ELEVATED LFTs: Noted to have elevation, attributed to metastatic
disease.

CODE: Patient was full code throughout.

Imaging:
TTE [**6-20**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with distal septal, anterior and apical akinesis (distal LAD
territory). The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =
40-45%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**11-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

CXR [**6-20**]:  Heart size is normal. Widening of the azygos contour
and convexity within the aorticopulmonary window are present, as
well as apparent thickening of the posterior wall of the
bronchus intermedius on the lateral view and symmetrical
narrowing of the lower trachea on the frontal view. Lungs are
clear except for minimal linear atelectasis versus scar at the
bases. Apparent bronchial wall thickening is noted in the lower
lungs on the lateral view, and note is also made of small
pleural effusions on this projection. Skeletal structures
demonstrate mild scoliosis and degenerative changes in the
spine, as well as healed right rib fractures.

CXR [**6-21**] s/p port placement: Interval placement of a right PICC
line with the tip in the distal superior vena cava. Cardiac and
mediastinal contours are essentially unchanged although hilar
contours are slightly prominent and have previously raised the
possibility of lymphadenopathy. Correlation with more remote
chest films would be advised. In the absence of a stability or
clinical explanation for this finding, consideration should be
given to further evaluation with CT.  Patchy opacity at the left
lung base may reflect an area of patchy atelectasis, although an
early pneumonia cannot be excluded. Clinical correlation
advised. No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.

ECHO [**2165-7-15**]:
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with distal
septal, anterior and apical akinesis. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**11-25**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Regional LV systolic dysfunction consistent with
distal LAD ischemia/infarction. Mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation. Mild PA hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-6-24**], no
change.

[**2165-7-18**] Bone Marrow Flow Cytometry:
FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT
FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING
The following tests (antibodies) were performed:  CD antigens 7,
13, 15, 33, 34, 117.

RESULTS:
Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to
optimize lymphocyte yield.

Cell marker analysis demonstrates that 2-4% of cells isolated
from this bone marrow express immature antigen, CD34, and
myeloid associated antigens CD33 and CD117.

INTERPRETATION
Immunophenotypic findings reveal 2-4% marrow events are CD34
positive myeloblasts.  While suggestive of regeneration,
correlation with morphology (bone marrow) S11-[**Numeric Identifier 91698**] W is
recommended for definitive diagnosis.

Bone Marrow Biopsy [**2165-7-18**]
SPECIMEN: BONE MARROW ASPIRATE AND CORE BIOPSY:

DIAGNOSIS:
     Hypercellular marrow for age bone marrow with
megakaryocytosis, myeloid predominance and left shift in myeloid
lineage

Note:  The findings are consistent with recovering marrow post
chemotherapy. By immunohistochemistry CD34 highlights
approximately 2-5% of blasts, while CD117 highlights
approximately 10% of blasts and promyelocytes and occasional
mast cells.  CD33 staining abundant immature and mature myeloid
elements (20%).  Glycophorin A stain highlights abundant
collections of erythroid precursors

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

Peripheral Blood Smear:

The smear is adequate for evaluation.  Erythrocytes exhibit
aniso- and poikilocytosis.  Echinocytes and dacrocytes are seen.
Frequent polychromatophils are noted. The white blood cell count
appears decreased.  Numerous dysplastic (monolobulated)
neutrophils with toxic granulations are present.  Immature
monocytes are present.  Platelet count appears increased;
multiple large and occasional giant forms are seen.
Differential count shows 55% neutrophils, 1% bands,  22 %
lymphocytes, 18% monocytes, 0% eosinophils, 0% basophils, 4%
blasts.  Blasts exhibit open nuclear chromatin , 1 - 2 prominent
nucleoli and scant amount of light-blue cytoplasm.

Aspirate Smear:

The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation.  However,
specimen quality appears to be compromised due to poor
preservation. The M:E ratio is 2.5:1 (normal).  Erythroid
precursors are normal in normal in number with dyspoietic
maturation.  Forms with asymmetric nuclear budding and irregular
nuclear contours are noted.  Myeloid precursors appear normal in
number and show left-shifted maturation.  Megakaryocytes are
present in increased numbers, abnormal forms are seen including
micromegakaryocytes, hypolobated and monolobated forms.

Differential (200 cells) shows:  <1% Blasts,  5% Promyelocytes,
15% Myelocytes, 11% Metamyelocytes, 33% Bands/Neutrophils, 0%
Plasma cells,  10% Lymphocytes, 25% Erythroid.   Rare blasts
(less than 1%) similar to the ones in the diagnostic marrow are
seen on scan.

Clot Section and Biopsy Slides:
The biopsy material is adequate for evaluation and consists of a
core biopsy specimen that measures 1.5 cm and length and
contains periosteum trabecular bone and bone marrow elements.
Bone marrow cellularity is approximately 70%.  The M:E ratio
estimate is increased.  Erythroid precursors are normal in
number and have normoblastic maturation.  Mild dysplasia seen.
Myeloid elements are increased in number and exhibit
left-shifted maturation. Megakaryocytes are present in markedly
increased numbers, are focally loosely and tightly clustered.
Several small interstitial aggregates comprised of small
lymphocytes are present and account for less than 5% of marrow
cellularity.  Marrow clot section is not submitted.  Numerous
hemosiderin-laden macrophages are noted.

FISH evaluation for a 5q deletion was performed with the
Vysis LSI EGR1/D5S23, D5S721 Dual Color Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**]
Molecular) for EGR1 at 5q31 and D5S721/D5S23 at 5p15.2 and
is interpreted as NORMAL. Two EGR1 hybridization signals
were observed in 97/100 nuclei examined, which is within
the normal range established for this probe in the
Cytogenetics Laboratory at [**Hospital1 18**]. Up to 3% of cells in
normal samples can show apparent 5q deletion using this
probe set. A normal EGR1 FISH finding can result from
absence of a 5q deletion, from a 5q deletion that does not
involve the region to which this probe hybridizes, or from
an insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.

FISH evaluation for a 7q deletion was performed with the
Vysis D7S522/CEP7 Dual Color Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) for
D7S522 at 7q31 and CEP7 (D7Z1) (chromosome 7 alpha
satellite DNA) at 7p11.1-q11.1 and is interpreted as
NORMAL. Two D7S522 hybridization signals were observed in
99/100 nuclei, which is within the normal range
established for this probe in the Cytogenetics Laboratory
at [**Hospital1 18**]. Up to 3% of cells in normal samples can show
apparent 7q deletion using this probe set. A normal
D7S522 FISH finding can result from the absence of a 7q
deletion, from a 7q deletion that does not involve the
region to which this probe hybridizes, or from an
insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.

FISH evaluation for a 20q deletion was performed with the
Vysis LSI D20S108 Probe ([**Doctor Last Name 7594**] Molecular) at 20q12 and is
interpreted as NORMAL. Two hybridization signals were
observed in 95/100 nuclei examined, which is within the
normal range established for this probe in the Cytogenetics
Laboratory at [**Hospital1 18**]. Up to 8% of cells in normal samples
can show apparent 20q deletion using this probe set. A
normal 20q FISH finding can result from absence of a 20q
deletion, from a 20q deletion that does not involve the
region to which this probe hybridizes, or from an
insufficient number of neoplastic cells in the specimen.

This test was developed and its performance
determined by the [**Hospital1 18**] Cytogenetics Laboratory
as required by the CLIA '[**41**] regulations. It has not
been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration. This test is used for clinical

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 91697**] is a 69yoM with h/o t2DM, hyperlipidemia, HTN, who
presented to PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2165-6-18**] with complaint of generalized
fatigue x1 month with sore throat and conjunctivitis, as well as
chest pain and dyspnea when exerting, diagnosed with new-onset
AML.  Admission c/b ICU transfer for afib with RVR in setting of
idarubicin treatment and hypotension s/p beta blocker.

# Newly diagnosed AML: blast count was as high as 80k at
presentation. Was started on hydroxurea, allopurinol, and
bicarb-[**Doctor First Name **] IVF, with a subsequent drop in WBC. Blast count was
as high as 60%. Although there was concern that starting
induction therapy may be risky for his heart, given low EF (see
below), cardiology was consulted and it was felt that the risk
of not treating AML was greater than the potentially cardiac
toxicity. He was started on 7+3 induction therapy
(cytarabine/idarubicin) on [**6-22**].  This was held on [**6-23**] due to
possible cardiac toxicity (see below), but then restarted on [**6-24**]
and completed without further event. Repeat bone marrow biopsy
was performed on [**2165-7-15**] (report attached).  Repeat echo on
[**2165-7-15**] showed unchanged LVEF.

#Febrile Neutropenia: spiked to 102.1 on admission ([**6-20**]).
Source is unknown. He did have sore throat and conjunctivitis as
that time which was thought could be viral. More likely is
related to his AML. No source of infection was identified, but
because of persistent febrile neutropenia, he was started on
cefepime, vancomycin, and micafungin.  Patient's fever came
down, but on the morning of HD6, he became febrile again to
100.6.  He had been noted to have expanding erythema at a site
where his IV had infiltrated, and there was suspicion of
cellulitis/phlebitis at that site.  Otherwise, patient received
blood cultures and urine cultures that were all negative.  As
the patient was already broadly covered, his antibiotics were
not changed.  The fever trended down by itself over the next
day.  Following chemotherapy, as his counts approached nadir, he
developed low grade fevers less than 100 F, but CT chest showed
only resolving cryptogenic organising pneumonia.  His fevers
resolved and he remained covered with broad spectrum antibiotics
until the end of his hospitalization.

#Atrial Fibrillation:  On [**6-23**], the patient was transferred to
the ICU for afib with RVR, possibly secondary to volume overload
vs. anthracycline toxicity vs. electrolyte abnormalities, as
well as hypotension, which resulted from attempted rate control
with beta blocker.  In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient spontaneously
converted back into NSR and was started on oral metoprolol
tartrate 25mg PO bid.  He was closely monitored for hemodyamic
stability through 4 days of idarubicin administration without
cardiac events. He remained in sinus rhythm for the rest of his
hospitalization.

# CHF - TTE on [**6-20**] showed EF 40-45% with anterior wall motion
dyskinesis. Given risk of anthracyclin cardiac toxicity,
cardiology was consulted and felt that chemo was still necessary
at this time, although with increased heart risk. They also felt
that he probably had an MI about 1 month ago. Pt developed chest
pain on [**6-21**], with unchanged EKG and troponin that stayed flat
at 0.05. He was fairly aggressively given bicarb [**Doctor First Name **] IVF in
preparation for chemo, and did 3rd space some fluid into his
lungs but as of [**6-22**] was saturating in high 90's on room air. He
was transfused pRBCs to keep hct >28.  Serial TTEs were
performed to monitor for deterioration of cardiac function while
on idarubicin.  TTE on [**6-24**] was unchanged from [**6-20**].  Patient
reported throughout admission that he has SOB when lying flat
and that his legs were swollen.  On exam, he had decreased lung
sounds in lower lobes bilaterally.  He was frequently diuresed
throughout the day with IV Lasix 20mg and kept at a fluid
balance of -500cc. Following transfer to the floor from the ICU,
he had no further problems with dyspnea.  Repeat TTE on [**2165-7-15**]
showed an unchanged LVEF and no new abnormalities since
pre-chemo.

#Anemia: Hct was 24 on admission. Patient??????s Hct kept trending
down with no obvious source of blood loss and no evidence of
hemolysis.  There is an expected pancyotpenia [**12-26**] chemo, however
twice he had had an abrupt drop that may be in excess of that
expected.  Patient denied GI bleeding, but later mentioned that
he had had several episodes of black-colored diarrhea that he
did not mention to medical staff.  His hemolysis labs were
negative.  He was transfused 2U of blood of [**6-25**] and 2U of blood
on [**6-27**].  During the [**6-25**] transfusion, patient complained of
dyspnea after the first unit of pRBCs and was found to have
congestion CXR, consistent with either pulmonary edema or TRALI.
 Blood bank was contact[**Name (NI) **] 2 days later about suspicion of TRALI,
however his symptoms resolved.  He received further transfusions
of blood and platelets as required without further event.

# Diabetes: Blood sugar at outside hospital <700, HgbA1c 11.6%.
[**Last Name (un) **] Endocrine was consulted, and started on RISS and standing
lantus, with improvement in blood sugars. His lantus was
downtitrated throughout admission and his ISS was changed to
humalog.  He was transitioned to po glimeperide for discharge.

Medications on Admission:
- lisinopril 20mg PO daily
- pravastatin 20mg PO daily (pt does not take this)
- erythromycin eye ointment since [**6-18**] for conjunctivitis

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr [**Known lastname 91697**],

It was a pleasure taking care of you at [**Hospital1 18**].

You were admitted to the hospital because you were found to have
leukemia. You were started on chemotherapy to treat this
leukemia.  When chemotherapy was started, you developed an
abnormal heart rhythm.  We started you on treatment for this,
but your blood pressure dropped and you were transferred to the
ICU.  However, your blood pressure and heart rhythm normalized
spontaneously without additional treatment and we transferred
you back to the [**Hospital1 **] to complete your chemotherapy.  You
completed your chemotherapy without any additional problems.

During your hospitalization you also had fevers.  We treated you
with antibiotics and your fevers resolved.

Please take the following medications following discharge:

provided by benzocaine topical spray. The posterior pharynx was anesthetized
with 2% viscous lidocaine. No TEE related complications. The rhythm appears to
be atrial flutter.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in
the body of the left atrium. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Impression: Mild spontaneous echo contrast in the left atrial appendage. No
thrombus in the left atrial appendage. Normal left ventricular function. Mild
mitral regurgitation.

tricuspid valve. Mild to moderate [[**1-7**]+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets. No
vegetation/mass on pulmonic valve.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. The patient was monitored
by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) 1**] [**Last Name (Titles) 2**] throughout the procedure. The posterior pharynx was
anesthetized with 2% viscous lidocaine. No TEE related complications. 0.1 mg
of IV glycopyrrolate was given as an antisialogogue prior to TEE probe
insertion. Echocardiographic results were reviewed by telephone with the MD
caring for the patient.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left or right
atrium/atrial appendage. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The right coronary cusp of the prosthetic aortic valve
appears thickened without a definite vegetation. A small paravalvular aortic
valve leak is present near the junction of the right and left coronary cusps.
No aortic valve abscess is seen. Trace (physiologic) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. No vegetation/mass is seen on the mitral, tricuspid or
pulmonic valves. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Thickened right coronary cusp of the bioprosthetic aortic valve
without evidence of endocarditis or aortic root abscess. If clinically
indicated, repeat TEE in the case of treatment failure may increase the
sensitivity of the study.
